/**
 * Turn seven dates plus the plan cache into what the week view renders.
 *
 * **A leftover says so.** `meal_plan_items.source_item_id` (BACKLOG 9.11) names the item whose
 * pot this meal eats again; the backend sets it when it carries a dish over a no-cook day
 * (`enforceNoCookCarryover`) and the batch-cook control sets it for the days one pot covers.
 * This used to be inferred — "the day before held this same `recipe_id`" — which is wrong
 * whenever reality is: cook the same dish twice on purpose and the second day was labelled
 * leftovers with no way to correct it.
 *
 * Which *kind* of repeat it is stays derived from `meal_plan_no_cook_days`: that is genuinely a
 * labelling question ("a day you chose not to cook" vs "a day you cooked ahead for"), not a
 * data one.
 *
 * `locale` is passed in rather than read off the i18n singleton, so this file stays pure and
 * `planDays.check.ts` keeps running under plain node.
 *
 * `priorDay` is the day *before* the window — a Monday's leftovers can point at Sunday's cook,
 * and without it that row cannot name the day it came from.
